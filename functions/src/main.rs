/*Statements and Expressions
Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an
expression.Because Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important
distinction to understand.
Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
Expressions evaluate to a resultant value. Letâ€™s look at some examples. */
